Please note, however, that under the Terms of Use we are not responsible for any problems you may encounter in using the site. And I often get asked, 'Why do I need a Riot password?' The reason is that while most of your statistics are freely accessible without a password, your store is considered sensitive information and is a notable exception. In order for the site to access your store, we need your login information in order to retrieve your store through the Third Party API. I wish Riot would implement them in their official API, but unfortunately they are not very enthusiastic about them.",
